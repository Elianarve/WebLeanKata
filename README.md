# Description


LeanKata is a web application developed with React that perfects the art of continuous improvement. It starts with our challenge boards to obtain solutions to problems using the lean methodology with a highly elaborate gear of boards that allows you to link them together. With an intuitive and attractive interface, you can explore different challenges, add, edit, modify, and delete new boards depending on their structure and where you are in the process. Additionally, you can include related images in the forms that require them.
